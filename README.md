# EcoCollab - A Social Media Platform to Help the Earth!
## What does this do?
It is a MERN Stack web app that allows people to connect and organize events to help the earth, as well as collect donations for a good cause.

The website can be accessed at: https://ecocollab.tennisbowling.com/

## Running the website locally
**NOTE:** This project contains both a **frontend** and **backend** folder. Keep them in the same structure as downloaded for now.

First, install Node.js (version >= 18.14.0) [here](https://nodejs.org/en)

Then go to your project folder in your terminal and install dependencies with these commands (copy paste to run all):
```cmd
cd ./frontend
npm i

cd ../backend
npm i
```
Once done, go into the frontend and backend folders in two different terminal windows, and run `npm run dev` in both. The website should now be accessible at `localhost:5173`
